Houdini
=======
Launch your rdesktop sessions from the menubar in OSX.

![Alt Houdini](https://github.com/danielwestendorf/Houdini/raw/master/64.png)

Features:
- Add as many hosts as you want
- Specify the username and domain
- Full screen or custom dimensions
- Launch with any of the command line switches

## Setup
Houdini requires that rdesktop is already installed. I suggest using homebrew for this.
Find out about homebrew here: <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>

  brew install rdesktop

This installs the rdesktop executable to /usr/local/bin/rdesktop.

If you've already instlaled rdesktop to another location, you need to specify it in the preferences.
